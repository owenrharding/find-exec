Improved upon iterate_over_files_in_dir to now execute any simple command (instead of just "echo" like before).
Has functionality to replace "{}" with each filename within directory, then execute the command each time.

Again modified the structure of the program to get past a stat(2) problem. Program now finds the name of the file with the directory pathway BEFORE checking stat, meaning that the DirArray is also created before. Added functions generate_filtered_directory, get_true_file_name, and add_file_to_dir_array.

Finally got piping to work. Was able to do this by changing my original method of creating two file descriptor arrays (inputFd and outputFd) to having one array holding only pipes.
This also allowed me to now put redirection INSIDE of the for loop which makes exit statistics far easier.

Fixed a bug. If --directory "." was given, "./" would not be added to filename during filename substitution as "." was set to the default directory if --directory was not set (that's a hard to read sentence). Now, if --directory "." is given, it will add "./" to the start of any filenames, if not, it will not add anything.

Changed sub_file function. Originally I had it as a recursive function, which worked alright, but I was getting frustrated with the structure and that it took an (at first call) unitialised variable to be added onto. Fixed it by writing new function sub_placeholder_in_string, which is now sequential.

Added sub_placeholders function, which implements functionality to initialise a struct which I've long had in my code. It takes a CommandPipeline*, and copies its contents over with placeholder substituted entities, returning a struct SubbedPipeline. Also added free_subbedpipeline whihc frees the contents.

Modified execute_command_pipeline to take a struct SubbedPipeline, rather than taking a CommandPipeline and handling placeholder substitution within the function. Functionality-wise, it is not too different, although it no longer calls error functions, and hence no longer prints error messages.
P.S. I am on absolute demon mode flow state today, I am unstoppable.

Fixed bug in code where children would still be created and execute commands later in the pipeline despite there already being an infile/outfile issue.
Fixed this by restructuring stdin/stdout redirection: checking if infile and outfile can be opened before created children, and if they can't, don't create child processes.

Slightly changed the structure of how pipelines are executed and waited on. Behviourally they are the same, although now execute_command_pipeline, while still returning a struct PidArray, now returns a PidArray which contains an array of struct ChildWorker. The ChildWorker struct is created for each child process created to execute a command, and contains the pid of the child, as well as the file name it was trying to process and the command it was trying to execute. This opens avenues for implementation of "parallel".
